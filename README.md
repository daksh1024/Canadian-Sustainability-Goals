# Canadian-Sustainability-Goals
Analyzing the Canadian Government's Initiatives to Reduce Carbon Footprint

## Introduction
Climate change is a global issue that has been a growing concern for governments worldwide. Burning of fossil fuels for numerous reasons generates green house gases that will in turn act as a blanket wrapped around our planet trapping sun’s heat and causing rise in global temperature commonly called global warming. This causes issues such as negative effects on various ecosystems, rising sea levels, saltwater intrusion, change in seasonal cycles, etc. Thousands of scientists and government reviewers concurred in a number of UN reports that keeping the increase in global temperature below 1.5°C would help humanity avoid the worst climate effects and maintain a habitable climate. Regrettably, present strategies predict a 2.8°C rise in temperature by the end of the century.
In light to these reports, the Canadian Government has targeted net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Furthermore, the provinces are taking different steps towards the same goal set by the central government. This project aims to analyze the Canadian Government's initiatives toward achieving its net-zero emission goal and the impact of these initiatives on renewable energy production and consumption across provinces.
We focus on analyzing energy consumption and emissions by the government facilities, industries and by residents. To get to net-zero emissions, renewable energy is the key. Therefore, we compare renewable source usage over the years and compare them with non-renewable sources. Lastly, we combine all the data and query to make a holistic comment on how the sustainability goals are being handled by the Canadian Government so far.

## Conclusion
Over this project we aggregated the finding on GHG emissions, energy consumption,
energy production to analyze if the initiatives taken by the Canadian government have
been effect so far and are they going to reach their goal of reach net zero emission by the
year 2050. Our conclusion is that they are dialling down on their own emission as well as
focusing on increasing the dependency on renewable sources. However, consumption
rates are pretty high and we infer that the toughest task they face is to make the citizens of
the country join them in their goals of sustainability. In our opinion this should be their
next point of focus.
As a future scope of this project, we can deep even deeper into residential consumptions
as well as industrial emissions policies to get insights into which reforms have worked and
which need to be updated.
